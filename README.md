# OPEN DATA OPEN MIC

As open data advocates, one of our frequent struggles is trying to get researchers interested and engaged in open data.   That struggle is why we attended the "By Researchers, For Researchers" workshop on how to promote scholarly communication at academic conferences during the FORCE 2016 conference in Portland, Oregon this week.

One of the exercises put participants in small groups to brainstorm actionable innovative ideas to engage researchers at the academic conferences THEY attend instead of expecting them to show up to ours.  I lucked into a group including Charlie Rapple, Raja Cholan, and Eva Montenegro.  

THE CHALLENGE

We started out acknowledging the barriers around engaging researchers at academic conferences:
1) pre & post conference workshops frequently require extra $$ to register for the workshop and / or travel costs for staying an extra day
2) there is a need from researchers to justify spending time & money at a workshop "not directly related" to their research
3) if communication is included in the body of the conference (through sessions, panels, etc) there is competition from concurrent sessions that are "more relevant"

OUR SOLUTION

Within an hour we came up with an idea we are calling Open Data Open Mic (other suggestions, welcome).

Basically, take the message out of the formal conference presentation formats and make it part of the informal discussion throughout the conference.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Stake out a space in the exhibit space of the conference.
	Originally we were thinking we could ask conference organizers for a table in a public space (preferably near a coffee cart) but a representative from an agency that hosts a couple conferences a year we talked to suggested conference organizers should WANT this and provide the exhibit space for free.

2. Identify champions to tell their open data success stories.
	Find a few highly regarded researchers in the discipline of focus for the conference that are willing to share success stories around open data.  During breaks and lunches schedule one or two of those champions to present their stories in 3-5 minutes in the exhibit space.  We will request permission to record so these stories can be saved to an online forum post-event.

3.  Invite others to tell their stories.
	After the champions tell their stories, open the mic and invite others to tell their open data success stories in 3-5 minute chunks.  We'd also ask permission to record these.

4. Develop an app to allow others to share & record their stories.
	This would be promoted through conference website, at exhibit space, in the conference program, through social media, etc.  This app would also be available to users outside the conference.  In between breaks and lunches at the conference, the exhibit space would be playing these recorded stories.

5. Website where stories are available also promotes other open data resources.
	This online forum would provide access to not only the recorded stories but promote other open data resources.  Examples could be links to events, training resources, organizations, tools, etc.

The end goal is to make the positive results of open data part of the informal conversation that takes place at academic conferences and to drive researchers to resources that provide opportunities to encourage and engage in open data practices.

WHAT WE WANT FROM YOU

What are your thoughts on this idea?  Do you have ideas to extend it or make it more effective?  What conferences should we target?  Are you a conference organizer that would be willing to host this?  Are you a researcher who would be willing to share your open data success story?
